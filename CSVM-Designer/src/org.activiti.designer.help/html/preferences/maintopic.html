	<h1>Preferences</h1>
	<p>
		On this page an overview of configuration options through Eclipse's preferences dialog is provided. To adjust preferences when using the Activiti Designer, 
		go to Window > Preferences in Eclipse and look for the "Activiti" menu item in the list on the left hand side. Some of the options described here are on 
		a subpage of the main Activiti item. For these options, click on the expand button (+) in front of the Activiti item and click on one the subpages that are shown.
	</p>
	
	<h2>General preferences</h2>
	
	<h3>Activity libraries</h3>
	
	<h2>Editor preferences</h2>
	
	<p>
		These preferences all have to do with the behavior of the designer when you are editing diagrams.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Default content for diagrams and subprocesses</h3>
	
	<p>
		This preference allows you to customize whether you want the Activiti designer to automatically put some default content into new diagrams you create. If you use 
		the wizard to create a new diagram, it will look at this preference to see whether a default process start should be made on the canvas. The same setting is 
		used to determine whether to place some default content in a new subprocess if you create one in a diagram.
