# CSVM Modelling and Validation Environment 
The *CSVM Modeling and Validation Environment is an environment for
modelling and validating business processes as well as service
compositions using
[SecureBPMN](https://www.brucker.ch/projects/securebpmn/index.en.html).
[SecureBPMN](https://www.brucker.ch/projects/securebpmn/index.en.html)
is a domain-specific modeling language that allows to model security
aspects (e.g., access control, separation of duty,
confidentiality). SecurePBPMN is defined as a meta-model that can
easily be integrated into BPMN and, thus, can be used for modeling
secure and business processes as well as secure service compositions.
